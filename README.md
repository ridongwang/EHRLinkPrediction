# EHRLinkPrediction
Linkprediction in EHR data using Biomedical knowledge base
  
  In this project we are trying to predict the missing links in the EHR data. We are predicting missing links due to lack of collection and documentation with the help of rule mining on EHR data. With the help of the mined rules we are able to predict the most common diagnosis in the EHR data. We have also integrated a biomedical knowledge base to the EHR data and used the information for predicting the diagnosis which are not that common in the EHR data.   We have used MIMIC-III data for the EHR and UMLS biomedical KB.
